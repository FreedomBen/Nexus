Nexus Version 0.3.0 - Tritium Pre-release Notes

This update contains many protocol level upgrades. To remain backwards
compatible on the protocol level with all previous updates, Tritium will be
released in 3 phases:

* Tritium

* Tritium Trust

* Tritium ++

Each of these updates contain a set of major upgrades and feature expansions.
The following in this pre-release note will briefly describe each update, will
expand on the new feature set of Tritium, and will describe the foundation of
the TAO architecture that is being created as a scaling, organizational, and
balanced solution for many issues that are apparent in the Bitcoin protocol.
