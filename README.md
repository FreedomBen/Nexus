What is Nexus?
--------------

Nexus is a framework of tools that can be used to create most of the applications on
the internet as we know it today. The core implementation is of a digital currency
that rides on the backbones of the network and provides a stable storage and transmission
of value from party to party. 

Nexus is a connection between two or more things, with this following code being a set of
tools to facilitate this connection between individuals. 

Why Nexus?
----------

Nexus provides the ability to improve the technology in digital currencies in the form of
continued development of new architecture, organizations, financial contracts, and even 
distributed consensus and voting with the proper checks and balances. When the entire
framework is complete, it will provide value to many other currencies besides nexus, and
be capable of allowing the world to form structured systems together that can operate 
independent of one another, and be connected through the distrubted network. This will 
create greater opportunity for those that have limited access to such things.

Development
-----------

Anyone is free to work on the source, `master` branch is regulary build and tested, but do
not consider it completely stable until full releases. Please submit pull requests at your
descretion if you would like to contribute to the core codebase. a contributing schematic
will be provided soon on our standard for development.


Tritium
-------

Tritium is the foundation of a series of updates called the TAO, which are designed to bring
this vision to full fruition through the development code. Tritium addresses some major parts
of the codebase See [RELEASE NOTES](doc/release-notes) for more information on the change logs.
